							</div>
							<div class="col-md-12">
								<p>
									Using AI-powered speech recognition can completely transform accessibility.
									Tools such as voice assistants, dictation tools, and real-time transcription
									capable of aiding users in their day-to-day lives.
									However, for neurodivgent users-- like those with autism,
									speech processing disorders, or ADHD-- these tools can often be more frustrating
									than helpful, potentially causing added confusion or overstimulation.
								</p>
								<p>
									Over the course of this semester, we learned that true accessibility in technology
									requires not only technical solutions, but also a shift in perspective-- moving
									from designing for the “average” user to embracing the full spectrum of human
									diversity.
									This means recognizing that neurodivergent users, with their unique means of
									communicating and processing information, must be consciously included in both the dataset
									training these AI models, as well as the teams building them.
									By centering inclusivity, we ensure that AI-driven tools genuinely
									empower all users, rather than reinforcing existing barriers.
								</p>
								<p>
									Neurodivergent users often utilitze rhythms, inflections, and phrasing during speech
									that are often underrepresented in traditional training sets.
									When AI models are trained primarily on “neurotypical” speech, they may misinterpret
									neurodivergent users’ words and input, leading to incorrect responses and repeated
									failures.
									And if the result is technology that alienates those it could benefit most, then
									clearly we as engineers have failed to execute an inclusive design.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, an individual with echolalia-- a condition often seen in autism where phrases
									are repeated out of context-- may frequently be misinterpreted by AI, causing the system to
									get stuck in loops and be more of a burden than a boon.
									Users with ADHD, on the other hand, may speak quickly or change topics fast, 
									with traditional speech models often struggling to keep up or maintain context.
								</p>
								<p>
									Applying a "virtue ethics" lens helps here.
									Instead of only asking what maximizes utility (as in Bentham-Mill's utilitarianism) 
									or what established rules to follow (like deontology), we should focus on character and compassion.
									An ethical technologist should strive to build systems structured around patience,
									empathy, and adaptability-- not perfection.
								</p>
								<p>
									Real systems like Google’s Project Euphonia are beginning to address this gap
									by training models on a more diverse set of voice patterns. While this is important
									progress, we believe this must become standard practise, not an isolated experiment.

									<h3>Google: Project Euphonia</h3>
									<p>
										Many people with speech impairments or atypical speech patterns-- 
										such as those with ALS, Down syndrome, or autism-- struggle to use
										mainstream speech recognition tools, which are typically trained
										on neurotypical voices.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>How AI/Assistive Tech Was Used:</b>
										Google’s Project Euphonia uses deep learning to train speech recognition
										models on thousands of voice samples from people with diverse speech patterns.
										By including their voices, the models become better at recognizing and
										transcribing atypical speech.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Impact/Outcome:</b>
										Project Euphonia has made it possible for people with speech impairments to
										use voice assistants and dictation software more reliably, increasing
										their independence and digital access.
										It also sets a new standard for inclusive AI design by involving users
										with disabilities in the development process.

									<h3>Microsoft: Immersive Reader</h3>
									<p>
										Students with dyslexia and other reading disabilities often struggle
										to access and comprehend written material, limiting their participation
										in mainstream classrooms.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>How AI/Assistive Tech Was Used:</b>
										Microsoft’s Immersive Reader uses AI to read text aloud,
										break words into syllables, and adjust text spacing and background color
										on challenging, text-heavy pages.
										These features help users decode and process content with greater ease.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Impact/Outcome:</b>
										Immersive Reader has improved reading comprehension and engagement for
										students with dyslexia and other learning/processing differences.
										It demonstrates how AI can be tailored to support neurodiverse learners
										and foster greater inclusion in education.

								In our group, we each explored different use cases where AI’s

								I focused on speech recognition for neurodivergent users to show

								We collaborated by sharing sources, reviewing each other’s drafts,
