							<h1 class="elements-h">Clear explanation of the issue/topic you selected</h1>
							<p>
								Ethical hiring practice in the tech industry refers to fair, transparent and inclusive
								processes for recruiting, selecting and onboarding new employees. It ensures that all
								candidates are treated equally regardless of their background, and that hiring decisions
								are based on merit, skills and cultural fit rather than on biases or discriminatory
								practices. Ethical hiring practices promote workplace diversity, reduce discrimination,
								and foster a culture of respect and equity.

					<!-- 2. Ethical Framework -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-12 elements-one-design">
							<h1 class="elements-h">Application of at least one ethical framework from the course</h1>
							<p>
								To evaluate hiring practices in tech ethically, we can apply the framework Rawls’ Theory
								of Justice. From Rawls’s theory of justice, particularly the original position and the
								veil of ignorance, we are asked to design systems as if we don’t know our own social
								standing including race, gender, background, or ability. If hiring systems were designed
								from this neutral standpoint, decision-makers would favor processes that protect the
								most vulnerable candidates and minimize the risk of bias. For example, hiring criteria
								would be clear and job relevant, and algorithmic tools would be audited for fairness,
								because no one would want to suffer discrimination from behind the veil. This theory
								reveals how current tech hiring often fails the fairness test by reinforcing systemic
								advantages.

							<p>
								Since 2014, a team from Amazon.com Inc. has been building a recruiting engine that will
								rate the job applicants’ resumes from one to five stars. And in 2015, the company found
								out that the system would frequently rate female applicants lower than their male
								counterparts. Since Amazon hopes the system will help them recruit favorable workers,
								the system was trained with resumes submitted to Amazon for software developer and
								technical roles from the past ten years, which are mainly from male applicants.
								Unknowingly, the system has been trained with biased data, as a result, the system will
								downgrade resumes that include some specific words, like “women’s”, as these words will
								appear less in a male’s resumes. The system violated the Rawls’ Theory of Justice’s
								principle of equal liberty, as it fails to provide equal chances for female candidates.

					<!-- 4. Practical Takeaways -->
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-12 elements-one-design elements-blockquote">
							<h1 class="elements-h">Practical takeaways</h1>
							<p><strong>Is our interview process accessible and fair?</strong><br>
								Have we accounted for neurodiversity, disability accommodations, and scheduling
								flexibility?<br>
								Are we standardizing interview questions to avoid bias?<br>
							</p>
							<p><strong>Who’s on our hiring panel?</strong><br>
								Diverse hiring panels bring different
								perspectives and reduce unconscious bias.</p>
							<p><strong>Where are we posting jobs?</strong><br>
								Are we reaching out to underrepresented communities (e.g., HBCUs, women in tech groups,
								neurodivergent communities)?</p>
							<p><strong>Have we defined what success looks like for this role and shared it clearly with
									candidates?</strong><br>
								Are expectations for performance, goals, and responsibilities transparent and
								realistic?<br>
								Have we avoided vague language or unspoken assumptions about the “ideal” candidate?
							</p>
							<p><strong>Are we providing timely and respectful feedback to all candidates?</strong><br>
								Regardless of whether they are moving forward in the process, are we closing the loop
								respectfully?
							</p>

							<p><strong>Are we offering candidates a chance to ask questions and express
									concerns?</strong><br>
								Do they feel safe to inquire about the role or the company culture without judgment?
							</p>

							<p><strong>Are we reflecting on each hiring cycle from an ethical standpoint?</strong><br>
								After each cycle, do we debrief on what went well and what could be improved?
