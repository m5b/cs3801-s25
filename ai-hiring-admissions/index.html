		    							AI in Hiring & Admissions is the use of artificial intelligence technologies
										 to help companies and schools manage the process of selecting applicants. 
										 AI is often used to screen resumes, analyze applications, or predict future success 
										 based on data patterns. The goal of using AI in these areas is to save time and make faster 
										 decisions when dealing with large numbers of candidates. However, using AI in this way raises 
										 concerns about fairness, bias, and transparency. It is important to consider how these 
										 systems are designed, how their decisions are made, and whether they treat all applicants 
										 equally and ethically.

		    					<div class="col-md-12">
		    						<p>
		    							The use of AI to screen and accept job applications presents both opportunities and ethical risks. 
										Two important ethical theories—Rawls’ Theory of Justice and Utilitarianism—help evaluate whether these 
										systems are fair and responsible. Rawls’ Theory of Justice emphasizes fairness and equal opportunity. 
										When applied to AI in hiring, this theory demands that all applicants, regardless of background, ability, 
										or identity, have the same chance to succeed. For instance, if an AI system evaluates candidates using video 
										interviews, it must not disadvantage individuals who are deaf, neurodivergent, or speak with an accent. Rawls 
										would argue that if such a system creates barriers for some groups, then it is unjust. He also introduces the 
										concept of the “veil of ignorance,” which asks us to design systems as if we don’t know who we’ll be when applying. 
										If we wouldn’t want to face that system as someone from a disadvantaged group, then it is not ethically acceptable. 
										Utilitarianism, on the other hand, evaluates ethical choices by measuring which action creates the greatest benefit 
										for the greatest number. In this view, AI in hiring may be justified because it speeds up the recruitment process, 
										reduces costs, and can even reduce certain types of human bias. Organizations benefit from efficiency, and applicants 
										may benefit from faster responses. However, utilitarian reasoning can overlook smaller groups who may be harmed by 
										the system—such as applicants who are misunderstood or misjudged due to AI errors or lack of accommodations. 
										A balanced ethical approach considers both perspectives. AI in hiring can be used responsibly if it maximizes 
										the overall benefit while also treating all applicants justly, particularly those who are most vulnerable to 
										unfair treatment. To do this, developers and employers must go beyond efficiency and take steps to ensure that AI 
										tools promote fairness, accessibility, and transparency throughout the hiring process.

		    							HireVue’s “glass box” video interviews are an AI powered, asynchronous screening tool 
										that makes an effort to make automated hiring more transparent and fair. It utilizes a 
										one way video format so candidates can record answers to a set of prerecorded questions 
										and allows employers to be more efficient with their time. HR Dive, the online news 
										network, reported about hard of hearing users having issues with financial software 
										company “Intuit” AI screening tool provided by HireVue. Those users mentioned that the AI 
										generated subtitles were mistranscribing just about every other word and made it harder to 
										follow along which led to them not doing as well in the interview as others who weren’t 
										hard of hearing. HR Dive also mentions that a deaf employee from Intuit requested human 
										generated captions but was denied. She had difficulties understanding the AI generated 
										subtitles in her interview and afterwards she was rejected for a promotion.

		    						<p>
		    							When using or designing AI tools in hiring and admissions, it's 
										important to think about fairness, access, and transparency. 
										Below are some tips and questions to keep in mind:
		    						</p>
		    					</div>

		    					<div class="col-md-12">
		    						<ul>
		    							<li>
		    								Check for Bias: Ask if the AI system has been tested for bias. 
											Does it treat all types of applicants fairly, including people 
											with disabilities or those from different backgrounds?
		    							</li>
		    							<li>
		    								Offer Alternatives: Make sure there are options for people who 
											may have trouble with AI tools (like subtitles for deaf users or 
											human review for unusual cases).
		    							</li>
		    							<li>
		    								Explain Decisions: Can someone clearly explain how the AI made its 
											decision? If not, that’s a red flag.
		    							</li>
		    							<li>
		    								Review Regularly: Don’t set the system and forget it. Keep checking 
											if the AI is making fair decisions as data and society change.
		    							</li>
										<li>
											Train Humans Too: AI should not replace human judgment. Make sure hiring 
											managers and admissions staff are trained to understand and question AI outcomes.
										</li>
										<li>
											Transparency for Users: Let applicants know when AI is being used and how it affects
											 them. Give them a chance to ask for a different method if needed.
										</li>
		    						</ul>
		    					</div>

								<div class="col-md-12">

		    							These steps help organizations use AI in a more ethical and responsible way.

		    						<p>
		    							Our group collaborated effectively on our topic because AI in hiring and admissions
										 is something we are all genuinely passionate for. Through consistent communication 
										 on Discord, which has allowed us to coordinate tasks, and share ideas. All the while 
										 being able to provide feedback in real-time. We each contributed research and content, 
										 and after agreeing on the direction and structure. We collected our work and uploaded 
										 it to GitHub. The collaborative process that we as a group has was marked by mutual 
										 respect, timely contributions, and most importantly a shared commitment. We as a team 
										 unanimously agreed on the idea of producing a cohesive and thoughtful final product.
