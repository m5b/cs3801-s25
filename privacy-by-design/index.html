								<h1 class="elements-h">What is Privacy by Design?</h1>
								<P>
									Developed by Ann Cavoukian, Privacy by Design is a design approach where the user’s privacy and data protection is put into consideration when designing an application or technology from the beginning rather than being considered after development. The user’s privacy and data protection is put on the same level of importance as the actual functionality of the application or technology.
								</P>
								<p>There are seven foundation principles of Privacy by Design:
									<ol>
										<li>Proactive no reactive; preventive no remedial</li>
										<br>
										Instead of waiting for privacy risks to happen, Privacy by Design aims to prevent them from happening entirely beforehand rather than resolving the risks after they occur.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>Privacy as the default setting</li>
										<br>
										When browsing a website, opening an application, or logging into software your privacy settings are already so that you have the highest level of protection even if you change the settings or not.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>Privacy embedded into design</li>
										<br>
										The protection of the user’s data and privacy should be in consideration throughout the development of a website or application and not just at the end of development, however not so much that it takes away focus from the actual functionality of it.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>Full functionality – Positive-sum, not zero-sum</li>
										<br>
										Privacy should not be traded off against other objectives such as security, functionality, or user experience as a zero-sum approach assumes that improving privacy must diminish usability or other features. Instead developers should strive for a positive-sum approach, where all objectives can be achieved without unnecessary compromise. Privacy should be integrated into the design process as a core function, not just as a matter of legal compliance, but as a way to build trust with users.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>End-to-end security - Lifecycle protection</li>
										<br>
										Data must be securely protected throughout its entire lifecycle, from the point of collection, through storage and use, to its eventual archiving and deletion. This ensures that privacy and security are maintained at every stage, minimizing risks such as unauthorized access, breaches, or misuse.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>Visibility and transparency - Keep it open</li>
										<br>
										Companies should be transparent with their users about how data is collected, used, and who has access to it. They should adhere to any policies communicated to users and ensure those policies are being followed through regular monitoring and accountability.
										<br>
										<br>
										<li>Respect for user privacy - Keep it user-centric</li>
										<br>
										Privacy measures should prioritize the user’s interests throughout the design process. Users should be provided with clear options that allow them to manage their own data. This approach empowers users to control what data is collected, how it is used, and who has access to it.
										<br>
										<br>
									</ol>

								<h1 class="elements-h">Real Example: DuckDuckGo Built for Privacy from the Start</h1>
								<p>
									DuckDuckGo is a search engine that focuses on protecting user privacy. Unlike most search engines such as Google, it does not track what you search, store your history, or build a profile on you to show ads. It also does not collect your IP address or follow you around the web. As soon as you start using it, your privacy is already protected. There is nothing you need to turn on, and you do not have to create an account.
								</p>
								<p>
									This is a clear example of Privacy by Design. From the beginning, DuckDuckGo was built to protect people automatically. One of the key ideas of Privacy by Design is that privacy should be the default setting, not something users have to search for in menus or settings. It is also about reducing how much data is collected in the first place. DuckDuckGo shows this in action by collecting almost no data at all.	
								</p>
								<p>
									What makes this different from just adding a privacy feature is that DuckDuckGo was designed around the idea of not needing personal data in the first place. Its entire system is built to work without tracking anyone. This shows that it is possible to create helpful tools while still respecting users' rights. In a world where many tech products rely on collecting and selling data, DuckDuckGo proves that there is a better way to build technology, one that puts the user first right from the start.
