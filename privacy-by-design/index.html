                            <p>
                                Developed by Ann Cavoukian, Privacy by Design is a design approach where the user’s privacy and data protection is considered from the very beginning—not just added on later. It puts privacy on the same level as functionality.

                                <li><strong>Proactive not reactive</strong> – Prevents risks before they happen.</li>
                                <li><strong>Privacy as the default</strong> – Strong privacy settings are built-in, not optional.</li>
                                <li><strong>Embedded in design</strong> – Privacy is integrated throughout development.</li>
                                <li><strong>Full functionality</strong> – Supports privacy *and* usability (not either/or).</li>
                                <li><strong>End-to-end security</strong> – Protects data through its full lifecycle.</li>
                                <li><strong>Visibility and transparency</strong> – Keeps users informed and systems accountable.</li>
                                <li><strong>Respect for user privacy</strong> – Gives users clear control over their data.</li>

                            <h3>Applying an Ethical Framework – Kantian Ethics</h3>
                            <p>
                                Privacy by Design connects well with Kantian ethics, which is all about treating people with respect and not just using them to reach some other goal. Immanuel Kant believed we should always treat individuals as ends in themselves, meaning we should respect their rights and choices.
                                <br><br>
                                When companies collect personal data without clearly asking or make privacy settings hard to find, they’re treating users more like tools than people. Privacy by Design changes that. It builds privacy into the system from the very start and makes the most protective settings the default. This way, users don’t have to dig through menus or opt out, their privacy is respected automatically.
                                <br><br>
                                Overall, Privacy by Design follows Kantian ethics by focusing on user respect and consent, not just what’s easiest or most profitable for the company.

                            <h3>Real Example: DuckDuckGo Built for Privacy</h3>
                            <p>
                                DuckDuckGo is a search engine that protects user privacy. Unlike other search engines, it doesn’t track what you search, store your history, or build a profile for ads. It doesn’t collect your IP address or follow you across the web.
                                <br><br>
                                This is a real-world example of Privacy by Design. It defaults to protecting your data from the moment you start using it—without needing to change any settings. DuckDuckGo was built from the ground up to avoid collecting personal data in the first place.
                                <br><br>
                                This makes it different from platforms that just *add* privacy features. Instead, DuckDuckGo’s entire system works without tracking you. It shows that it’s possible to build useful tools that put users first and respect privacy by default.

                            <p>
                                Our group was tasked with exploring the principles and real-world
								 applications of Privacy by Design. We collaboratively conducted 
								 research, engaged in group discussions, and shared feedback to ensure
								  a well-rounded and thoughtful approach. Through this process, we were 
								  able to combine theoretical insights with practical examples to illustrate
								   the relevance of Privacy by Design in today’s digital world. One notable
								    example we focused on is DuckDuckGo, a search engine specifically designed
									 to protect user privacy. DuckDuckGo exemplifies the Privacy by Design approach
									  developed by Ann Cavoukian, in which user privacy and data protection are
									   proactively considered from the outset. The platform incorporates several
									    of the seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design, such as Privacy
										 as the Default Setting and Privacy Embedded into Design. By limiting data
										  collection and avoiding user tracking, DuckDuckGo shows how privacy can be
										   built directly into a system, rather than treated as an add-on.
